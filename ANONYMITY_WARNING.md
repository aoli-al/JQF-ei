- We follow the JQF convention and use the same package name `edu.berkeley.cs` as JQF.

- Part of our implementation has already been merged into the upstream JQF repository. 
Searching the commit history of JQF could potentially reveal our identity.

- The experiment data are stored in `paper-data` folder.

- The script that processes the experiment data is located in `scripts/experiments/ei/paper_figs_viewer.ipynb`
